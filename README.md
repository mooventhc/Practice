# Zomato price trend and sentiment analysis

## Problem:-

- The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of the restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. 
- With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasn't been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. Inspite of increasing demand it, however, has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. 
- Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they donâ€™t have time to cook for themselves.
